hsetroot - imlib2-based wallpaper changer

original author: Hyriand <hyriand@thegraveyard.org> (2003)
licence: GPL2
needs libimlib2-dev, libx11-dev, pkg-config

includes patches from debian, various authors, details in git log
	`-cover` and `-extend` added

screen mask added: `-screens` .. which is rather useless actually, as it deals with X screens, not xrandr outputs

current TODO:

[ ] single image across all *outputs*
[ ] the same image on each output
[ ] providing a list of images to be used in sequence across outputs (iterated over in TL->TR->BL->BR direction)

# TODO rework command line option parsing, use something
